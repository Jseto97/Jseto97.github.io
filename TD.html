				<h1>TD Bank - My Forage into the World of Digital Strategy</h1>
				<p> Over the course of the summer of 2018 I was given the privilege and the opportunity to work at TD Canada Trust as a digital strategist on the Mobile Channels Innovation team.
					Our directive was to perpetuate the core values of TD, inclusion, user-centric design and uniqueness through innovative solution development.  </p>
				<p> As a digital strategist and pm intern I was exposed to the multi-faceted ecosystem of mobile development and design from the lens of digital strategy.
					Over the course of my internship I worked on two distinctive teams in mobile investing and mobile insurance. Defined by two simultaneous projects under and agile framework; my methodology over the internship was
					to take ownership of my work through the application of user empathy and design thinking. Over 4 months, 8 sprints and continuous iteration, my work lead to an eventual POC creation,
					user validation and patent filing for which I was listed as a primary inventor.</p>
