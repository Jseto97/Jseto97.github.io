				<h1>TD Bank - My Forage into the World of Digital Strategy</h1>
				<p> Over the course of the summer of 2018 I was given the privilege and the opportunity to work at TD Canada Trust as a digital strategist on the Mobile Channels Innovation team.
					Our directive was to perpetuate the core values of TD, inclusion, user-centric design and uniqueness through innovative solution development.  </p>
				<p> As a digital strategist and pm intern I was exposed to the multi-faceted ecosystem of mobile development and design from the lens of digital strategy.
					Over the course of my internship I worked on two distinctive teams in mobile investing and mobile insurance. Defined by two simultaneous projects under and agile framework; my methodology over the internship was
					to take ownership of my work through the application of user empathy and design thinking. Over 4 months, 8 sprints and continuous iteration, my work lead to an eventual POC creation,
					user validation and patent filing for which I was listed as a primary inventor.</p>
					<p>Please contact me to view my patent work as the details are currently under NDA, if you have done so you can
						view my work <strong><a class="und" href="https://goo.gl/forms/1IZU1uKEdrkHTcCt1">here</a></strong></p>

				<h2>PWA Investigation</h2>
					<p>Under the guidance of my mentor and direct report Harj Panag,
						I conducted an investigation into the usage of Progressive Web Applications or <strong><a  title="google pwa" class='und' href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">
						PWAs</a></strong>, a framework
						released by Google in the 2017 developer summit; for which frontend developers could
						 leverage to go beyond mere responsiveness in web applications. The investigation
						 focused on the application of PWAâ€™s in the mobile banking space for the creation of prototypes that
						  were scalable and responsive; allowing a depth of visualization and testing that a wireframe could not
							 provide. My findings were summarzied in a short presentaion and infographic, leading to the usage of Progressive Web Applications in the development of Proof of Concepts
							  within the mobile channel teams.

					<h2>Chat Bot Competitor Analysis</h2>
					<p> One of my earliest projects as a PM was to conduct competitor analysis for the release of TD's
						<strong><a class="und" href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/td-canada-ios-app-td-clari/" title="Chatbot News">Chatbot</a></strong>.
						This project would lead to the eventual creation of one of the defining projects of my internship.
						In order to visualize the data from my research I needed a way to display screens and user flows of multiple competitors
						in a cohesive environment. I decided to deviate from the norm of slide decks and utilized my knowledge of the design tool
						Figma to create an unorthodox break down of competitor onboarding. The result was a figma "mockup" that allowed the presenter
						to easily navigate through multiple different screens, with notable elements being highlighted by figma comments.
						My creative usage of a non-traditional methodology was presented to the wealth board of directors and commended, leading to the approval
						of 7 million dollars in funding for the development of a chat-based onboarding process.

					<p> The penultimate project of my time at TD was a massive undertaking that spanned 4 sprints and 3 months, which cumulated into motion a new framework for
